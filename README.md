# COVID-19 Tracker
A website that is run using a LAMP server to track new and confirmed cases/deaths. Scrapes a website (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) for this information.

## How do you run this?
I run the website using the Windows Subsystem for Linux in combination with files from this repository. Using the Linux shell, I move the necessary files into the proper Linux directory. This Linux subsystem hosts the Apache HTTP server, the MySQL database, and the files for the website itself (such as the main PHP file).
